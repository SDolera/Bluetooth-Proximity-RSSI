# Bluetooth-Proximity-RSSI
AVR-based Bluetooth proximity detection system using BLE RSSI to classify distance levels and trigger adaptive buzzer alerts.

Designed and implemented a real-time BLE-based proximity detection system that classifies signal strength into distance zones (Very Close / Near / Far) and provides adaptive audio alerts.
Developed using low-level AVR C with structured driver separation (UART, GPIO, Buzzer)
